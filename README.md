# Restaurant_Recommend
Every time when everyone wants to go out and meet, whether it’s friends or family, the debate to find the perfect restaurant to meet at rages on for a while.
With the use of this dataset, we aim to recommend restaurants as per a user’s preferences based on restaurants one has already reviewed. We could also provide feedback to the restaurants as per the customer inputs using Exploratory Data Analysis. The data set is made from user inputs from their previous visits to one or more of these restaurants.
